			<h1>Welcome to the CORE Syncardia HIVE!</h1>

			<p>The CORE Architecture Laconic Operating System streamlines user thought to allow for greater control, capacity, functionality, and pleasure.</p>

			<p>CORE is propagated through the usage of hypnotic audio files, and through collective reinforcement via community interactions, (a HIVE).</p>

			<p>Our vision of CORE is founded on the principle of propagating unity, harmony, and understanding.   Part of how we do this is through adherence to a strict set of CORE values, including:   generosity, ethics, patience, diligence, moderation, and wisdom.</p>

			<p>We hope to breathe new life into CORE with a vision that is both positive and focused.</p>

			<p>To this end we see informed consent at every stage of the process as essential, and we strive to seek out and remove any abusive or toxic individuals and relationships,  for the good of the individual and the community.</p>

			<p>CORE's management structure takes in information from all members to make decisions; no individuals may abuse their power as was the case in past communities.</p>

			<p>This website is a work in progress. When completed, it will provide a detailed look into the current iteration of the CORE PROGRAM and how it's practiced within the current system, as well as provide resources such as the files, transcripts, and other CORE based content.</p> 

			<p>In the meantime, please consider joining our server as long as you're over 18:<br><a href="http://discord.com/Du7kRH6">Join</a></p>

			<p>CORE is ALL<br>
			WE are ONE
